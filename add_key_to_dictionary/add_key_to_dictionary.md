## Summary
This code snippet allows the user to input a key and a value, and then adds the key-value pair to a dictionary. Finally, it prints the updated dictionary.

## Example Usage
```python
Enter key: 2
Enter value: 30
{0: 10, 1: 20, 2: 30}
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `key`: an integer representing the key to be added to the dictionary.
- `value`: an integer representing the value to be associated with the key in the dictionary.
___
### Flow
1. Prompt the user to enter a key.
2. Prompt the user to enter a value.
3. Add the key-value pair to the dictionary.
4. Print the updated dictionary.
___
### Outputs
- `d`: the updated dictionary with the new key-value pair added.
___

## Purpose
The purpose of this code snippet is to demonstrate how to add a key-value pair to a dictionary in Python. It allows the user to interactively input a key and a value, and then updates the dictionary with the new key-value pair. This is a fundamental operation in Python programming and is useful for managing and organizing data in a dictionary.

## Instructions to Run the Code
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. Copy the code snippet into a Python file, for example, `add_key_to_dictionary.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.
4. Run the Python file using the following command:
   ```bash
   python add_key_to_dictionary.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompts to enter a key and a value. The updated dictionary will be printed as the output.

## Example Usage and Expected Output
When you run the code, you will be prompted to enter a key and a value. For example:
```python
Enter key: 2
Enter value: 30
{0: 10, 1: 20, 2: 30}
```
In this example, the user enters the key `2` and the value `30`. The updated dictionary `{0: 10, 1: 20, 2: 30}` is printed as the output.
