## Summary
This function checks if a given list of binary numbers is divisible by 5.

## Example Usage
```python
binary_numbers = "101,110,111,1001"
result = check_binary_divisibility(binary_numbers)
print(result)
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `bin_numbers`: a string containing a comma-separated list of binary numbers.
___
### Flow
1. Split the `bin_numbers` string into individual binary numbers using the comma as a delimiter.
2. Iterate over each binary number.
3. Convert each binary number to its decimal equivalent using `int(num, 2)`.
4. Check if the decimal number is divisible by 5 using the modulo operator `%`.
5. If the number is divisible by 5, add it to the `divisible_by_5` list.
6. Join the numbers in the `divisible_by_5` list with commas using `','.join(divisible_by_5)`.
7. Return the resulting string.
___
### Outputs
- A string containing the binary numbers from the input list that are divisible by 5.
___

## Purpose
The purpose of this code snippet is to demonstrate how to check the divisibility of binary numbers by 5. It allows the user to input a list of binary numbers and returns the binary numbers that are divisible by 5. This is useful for understanding how to work with binary numbers and perform divisibility checks in Python.

## Instructions to Run the Code
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. Copy the code snippet into a Python file, for example, `binary_divisibility.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.
4. Run the Python file using the following command:
   ```bash
   python binary_divisibility.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompt to enter a comma-separated list of 4-digit binary numbers. The binary numbers that are divisible by 5 will be printed as the output.

## Example Usage and Expected Output
When you run the code, you will be prompted to enter a comma-separated list of 4-digit binary numbers. For example:
```python
Enter comma separated 4 digit binary numbers: 1010,1100,1111,1001
1010
```
In this example, the user enters the binary numbers `1010`, `1100`, `1111`, and `1001`. The binary number `1010` is divisible by 5, so it is printed as the output.
