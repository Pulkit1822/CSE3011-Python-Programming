## Summary
This code defines a function named `calculate_average` that calculates the average of a given number of students' marks.

## Example Usage
```python
average = calculate_average(3)
print(average)
```
This code will prompt the user to enter the marks of 3 students, calculate their average, and then print the result.

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `num_students`: an integer representing the number of students for which the average needs to be calculated.
___
### Flow
1. Initialize `total_marks` variable to 0.
2. Iterate `num_students` times:
   - Prompt the user to enter a student's mark.
   - Add the entered mark to `total_marks`.
3. Calculate the average by dividing `total_marks` by `num_students`.
4. Return the calculated average.
___
### Outputs
- `average`: a float representing the average of the students' marks.
___

## Purpose
The purpose of this code snippet is to demonstrate how to calculate the average of a given number of students' marks in Python. It allows the user to input the number of students and their respective marks, and then calculates and prints the average. This is a fundamental operation in Python programming and is useful for understanding how to work with loops and arithmetic operations.

## Instructions to Run the Code
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. Copy the code snippet into a Python file, for example, `calculate_average.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.
4. Run the Python file using the following command:
   ```bash
   python calculate_average.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompt to enter the number of students and their respective marks. The average of the students' marks will be printed as the output.

## Example Usage and Expected Output
When you run the code, you will be prompted to enter the number of students and their respective marks. For example:
```python
Enter the number of students: 3
Enter student's mark: 85
Enter student's mark: 90
Enter student's mark: 78
The average marks of 3 students is: 84.33333333333333
```
In this example, the user enters the number of students as `3` and their respective marks as `85`, `90`, and `78`. The average marks `84.33333333333333` is printed as the output.
