## Summary
This function calculates the electricity bill based on the number of units consumed.

## Example Usage
```python
bill = calculate_electricity_bill(100)
print(bill)
```
Output:
```
82.5
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- units: an integer representing the number of units consumed
___
### Flow
1. Check if the number of units is less than or equal to 50. If true, calculate the bill by multiplying the units by 0.50.
2. If the number of units is greater than 50, check if it is less than or equal to 150. If true, calculate the bill by adding the cost of the first 50 units (50 * 0.50) to the cost of the remaining units ((units - 50) * 0.75).
3. If the number of units is greater than 150, check if it is less than or equal to 250. If true, calculate the bill by adding the cost of the first 50 units (50 * 0.50), the cost of the next 100 units (100 * 0.75), and the cost of the remaining units ((units - 150) * 1.20).
4. If the number of units is greater than 250, calculate the bill by adding the cost of the first 50 units (50 * 0.50), the cost of the next 100 units (100 * 0.75), the cost of the next 100 units (100 * 1.20), and the cost of the remaining units ((units - 250) * 1.50).
5. Calculate the surcharge by multiplying the bill by 0.20.
6. Calculate the total bill by adding the bill and the surcharge.
___
### Outputs
- total_bill: a float representing the total electricity bill, including the surcharge.
___

## Purpose
The purpose of this code snippet is to demonstrate how to calculate the electricity bill based on the number of units consumed. It allows the user to input the number of units and then calculates and prints the total bill, including the surcharge. This is a practical example of how to work with conditionals and arithmetic operations in Python.

## Instructions to Run the Code
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. Copy the code snippet into a Python file, for example, `calculate_electricity_bill.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.
4. Run the Python file using the following command:
   ```bash
   python calculate_electricity_bill.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompt to enter the number of units consumed. The total electricity bill, including the surcharge, will be printed as the output.

## Example Usage and Expected Output
When you run the code, you will be prompted to enter the number of units consumed. For example:
```python
Enter the number of units consumed: 100
The total electricity bill is: Rs. 82.50
```
In this example, the user enters the number of units consumed as `100`. The total electricity bill `Rs. 82.50` is printed as the output.
