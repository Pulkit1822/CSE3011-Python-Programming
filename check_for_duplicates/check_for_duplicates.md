## Summary
The code snippet takes a list of integers as input from the user, converts it into a set, and then compares the length of the set with the length of the original list to determine if there are any duplicate elements in the list.

## Example Usage
```python
Enter the list elements: 1 2 3 4 5
No, list does not contain duplicate element

Enter the list elements: 1 2 3 4 4
Yes, list contains duplicate element
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- A list of integers entered by the user.
___
### Flow
1. The code prompts the user to enter the list elements.
2. The input is split into individual elements and converted into a list of integers using the `map()` function.
3. The list is then converted into a set using the `set()` function.
4. The code compares the length of the set with the length of the original list.
5. If the lengths are equal, it means there are no duplicate elements in the list and the code prints "No, list does not contain duplicate element".
6. If the lengths are not equal, it means there are duplicate elements in the list and the code prints "Yes, list contains duplicate element".
___
### Outputs
- "No, list does not contain duplicate element" if there are no duplicate elements in the list.
- "Yes, list contains duplicate element" if there are duplicate elements in the list.
___

## Purpose
The purpose of this code snippet is to demonstrate how to check for duplicate elements in a list using Python. It allows the user to input a list of integers and then determines if there are any duplicate elements in the list. This is a fundamental operation in Python programming and is useful for understanding how to work with sets and lists.

## Instructions to Run the Code
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. Copy the code snippet into a Python file, for example, `check_for_duplicates.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.
4. Run the Python file using the following command:
   ```bash
   python check_for_duplicates.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompt to enter the list elements. The code will determine if there are any duplicate elements in the list and print the result.

## Example Usage and Expected Output
When you run the code, you will be prompted to enter the list elements. For example:
```python
Enter the list elements: 1 2 3 4 5
No, list does not contain duplicate element

Enter the list elements: 1 2 3 4 4
Yes, list contains duplicate element
```
In this example, the user enters the list elements `1 2 3 4 5` and `1 2 3 4 4`. The code determines that the first list does not contain duplicate elements, while the second list does contain duplicate elements, and prints the corresponding messages.
