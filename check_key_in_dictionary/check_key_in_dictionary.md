This code snippet checks if a given key exists in a dictionary.

## Example Usage
```python
Enter a key: 'a'
Key already exists.
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `key`: a string representing the key to be checked in the dictionary.
___
### Flow
1. Prompt the user to enter a key.
2. Check if the entered key exists in the dictionary.
3. If the key exists, print 'Key already exists.'
4. If the key does not exist, print 'Key does not exist.'
___
### Outputs
- 'Key already exists.' if the entered key exists in the dictionary.
- 'Key does not exist.' if the entered key does not exist in the dictionary.
___

## Purpose
The purpose of this code snippet is to demonstrate how to check if a given key exists in a dictionary in Python. It allows the user to input a key and then checks if the key exists in the dictionary. This is a fundamental operation in Python programming and is useful for managing and organizing data in a dictionary.

## Instructions to Run the Code
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. Copy the code snippet into a Python file, for example, `check_key_in_dictionary.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.
4. Run the Python file using the following command:
   ```bash
   python check_key_in_dictionary.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompt to enter a key. The code will check if the key exists in the dictionary and print the result.

## Example Usage and Expected Output
When you run the code, you will be prompted to enter a key. For example:
```python
Enter a key: 'a'
Key already exists.
```
In this example, the user enters the key `'a'`. The code checks if the key exists in the dictionary and prints the corresponding message.
