## Summary
The code snippet takes input from the user for the number of elements and then prompts the user to enter each element. It appends the unique elements to a list. Finally, it checks if the length of the unique elements list is equal to the number of elements entered by the user and prints whether all elements are unique or not.

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `number_of_elements`: an integer representing the number of elements to be entered by the user.
- `element`: an integer representing each element entered by the user.
___
### Flow
1. The code prompts the user to enter the number of elements.
2. It initializes an empty list called `unique_elements_list`.
3. It enters a loop that runs `number_of_elements` times.
4. Inside the loop, it prompts the user to enter an element.
5. If the entered element is not already present in the `unique_elements_list`, it appends it to the list.
6. After the loop ends, it checks if the length of the `unique_elements_list` is equal to `number_of_elements`.
7. If the lengths are equal, it prints "All elements are unique".
8. Otherwise, it prints "Not all elements are unique".
___
### Outputs
- "All elements are unique" if all the entered elements are unique.
- "Not all elements are unique" if there are duplicate elements among the entered elements.
___

## Purpose
The purpose of this code snippet is to demonstrate how to check if all elements in a list are unique in Python. It allows the user to input a number of elements and then checks if all the entered elements are unique. This is a fundamental operation in Python programming and is useful for understanding how to work with lists and conditionals.

## Instructions to Run the Code
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. Copy the code snippet into a Python file, for example, `check_unique_elements.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.
4. Run the Python file using the following command:
   ```bash
   python check_unique_elements.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompt to enter the number of elements and each element. The code will determine if all the entered elements are unique and print the result.

## Example Usage and Expected Output
When you run the code, you will be prompted to enter the number of elements and each element. For example:
```python
Enter number of elements: 5
Enter an element: 1
Enter an element: 2
Enter an element: 3
Enter an element: 2
Enter an element: 4
Not all elements are unique
```
In this example, the user enters 5 elements: 1, 2, 3, 2, and 4. Since the element 2 is repeated, the code outputs "Not all elements are unique".
