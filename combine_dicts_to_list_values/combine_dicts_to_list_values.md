## Summary
The code snippet is a function called `combine_dicts_to_list_values` that takes in multiple dictionaries as arguments and combines them into a single dictionary where the values for each key are stored in a list.

## Example Usage
```python
dict1 = {"w": 50, "x": 100, "y": "Green", "z": 400}
dict2 = {"x": 300, "y": "Red", "z": 600}
combine_dicts_to_list_values(dict1, dict2)
```
Expected Output:
```
Original dictionaries:
{'w': 50, 'x': 100, 'y': 'Green', 'z': 400}
{'x': 300, 'y': 'Red', 'z': 600}

Combined dictionaries, creating a list of values for each key:
{'w': [50], 'x': [100, 300], 'y': ['Green', 'Red'], 'z': [400, 600]}
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `dict1`: A dictionary containing key-value pairs.
- `*dict_list`: Variable number of dictionaries.
___
### Flow
1. The function takes in a dictionary `dict1` and a variable number of dictionaries `*dict_list`.
2. It prints the original dictionaries.
3. It initializes an empty dictionary `combined_dict`.
4. It iterates over each dictionary in `[dict1, *dict_list]`.
5. For each key-value pair in the dictionary, it checks if the key already exists in `combined_dict`.
6. If the key does not exist, it creates a new list with the value and assigns it to the key in `combined_dict`.
7. If the key already exists, it appends the value to the existing list for that key in `combined_dict`.
8. Finally, it prints the combined dictionary.
___
### Outputs
- `combined_dict`: A dictionary where the values for each key are stored in a list.
___

## Purpose
The purpose of this code snippet is to demonstrate how to combine multiple dictionaries into a single dictionary where the values for each key are stored in a list. This is useful for aggregating data from multiple sources and organizing it in a structured manner.

## Instructions to Run the Code
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. Copy the code snippet into a Python file, for example, `combine_dicts_to_list_values.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.
4. Run the Python file using the following command:
   ```bash
   python combine_dicts_to_list_values.py
   ```
5. The combined dictionary with values stored in lists will be printed as the output.

## Example Usage and Expected Output
When you run the code, you will see the original dictionaries and the combined dictionary with values stored in lists. For example:
```python
dict1 = {"w": 50, "x": 100, "y": "Green", "z": 400}
dict2 = {"x": 300, "y": "Red", "z": 600}
combine_dicts_to_list_values(dict1, dict2)
```
Expected Output:
```
Original dictionaries:
{'w': 50, 'x': 100, 'y': 'Green', 'z': 400}
{'x': 300, 'y': 'Red', 'z': 600}

Combined dictionaries, creating a list of values for each key:
{'w': [50], 'x': [100, 300], 'y': ['Green', 'Red'], 'z': [400, 600]}
```
