## Summary
This code snippet prompts the user to enter the number of keys for a dictionary and then asks for the key-value pairs. It creates a dictionary with the entered key-value pairs and prints the resulting dictionary.

## Example Usage
```python
Enter the number of keys: 3
Enter the key: 1
Enter the value: 10
Enter the key: 2
Enter the value: 20
Enter the key: 3
Enter the value: 30
{1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30}
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `num_keys`: an integer representing the number of keys for the dictionary
- `key`: an integer representing the key for each key-value pair
- `value`: an integer representing the value for each key-value pair
___
### Flow
1. The code prompts the user to enter the number of keys for the dictionary.
2. It then iterates over the range of keys.
3. For each key, it prompts the user to enter the key and value.
4. It adds the key-value pair to the `new_dict` dictionary.
5. Finally, it prints the resulting dictionary.
___
### Outputs
- `new_dict`: a dictionary containing the entered key-value pairs.
___

## Purpose
The purpose of this code snippet is to demonstrate how to create a dictionary by prompting the user to enter key-value pairs. It allows the user to interactively input the number of keys and their corresponding values, and then constructs and prints the resulting dictionary. This is a fundamental operation in Python programming and is useful for understanding how to work with dictionaries and user input.

## Instructions to Run the Code
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. Copy the code snippet into a Python file, for example, `concatenate_dictionaries.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.
4. Run the Python file using the following command:
   ```bash
   python concatenate_dictionaries.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompts to enter the number of keys and their corresponding values. The resulting dictionary will be printed as the output.

## Example Usage and Expected Output
When you run the code, you will be prompted to enter the number of keys and their corresponding values. For example:
```python
Enter the number of keys: 3
Enter the key: 1
Enter the value: 10
Enter the key: 2
Enter the value: 20
Enter the key: 3
Enter the value: 30
{1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30}
```
In this example, the user enters the number of keys as `3` and their corresponding values as `10`, `20`, and `30`. The resulting dictionary `{1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30}` is printed as the output.
