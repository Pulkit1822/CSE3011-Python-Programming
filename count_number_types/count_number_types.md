### Code Snippet: Count Positive, Negative, and Zero Numbers

#### Inputs
The code snippet takes input from the user in the form of integer numbers.

#### Flow
1. The code snippet initializes three variables to keep track of the counts of positive, negative, and zero numbers.
2. It enters a while loop that continues until the user enters 0.
3. Inside the loop, it prompts the user to enter a number.
   - If the number is greater than 0, it increments the positive count variable.
   - If the number is less than 0, it increments the negative count variable.
   - If the number is equal to 0, it increments the zero count variable and breaks out of the loop.
4. After the loop ends, it prints the counts of positive, negative, and zero numbers entered by the user.

#### Outputs
The code snippet outputs the counts of positive, negative, and zero numbers entered by the user.

```python
def count_numbers():
    positive_count = 0
    negative_count = 0
    zero_count = 0

    while True:
        num = int(input("Enter a number (enter 0 to stop): "))
        if num > 0:
            positive_count += 1
        elif num < 0:
            negative_count += 1
        else:
            zero_count += 1
            break

    print(f"Positive numbers entered: {positive_count}")
    print(f"Negative numbers entered: {negative_count}")
    print(f"Zeroes entered: {zero_count}")

count_numbers()
```

## Purpose
The purpose of this code snippet is to demonstrate how to count the number of positive, negative, and zero numbers entered by the user in Python. It allows the user to input a series of numbers and then calculates and prints the counts of positive, negative, and zero numbers. This is a fundamental operation in Python programming and is useful for understanding how to work with loops and conditionals.

## Instructions to Run the Code
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. Copy the code snippet into a Python file, for example, `count_number_types.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.
4. Run the Python file using the following command:
   ```bash
   python count_number_types.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompt to enter a series of numbers. The code will determine the counts of positive, negative, and zero numbers and print the result.

## Example Usage and Expected Output
When you run the code, you will be prompted to enter a series of numbers. For example:
```python
Enter a number (enter 0 to stop): 5
Enter a number (enter 0 to stop): -3
Enter a number (enter 0 to stop): 0
Positive numbers entered: 1
Negative numbers entered: 1
Zeroes entered: 1
```
In this example, the user enters the numbers `5`, `-3`, and `0`. The code determines the counts of positive, negative, and zero numbers and prints the corresponding messages.
